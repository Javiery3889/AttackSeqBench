Alright, I've got this question about the Sunburst backdoor and whether it's likely to communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation. The answer choices are simply "Yes" or "No." Now, I need to decide which one makes more sense based on the related TTPs provided.

First, let's break down the question. So, there was a supply-chain attack on SolarWinds, and the Sunburst backdoor was delivered through that. The question is asking about what happens after that—specifically, whether the backdoor is likely to use a protocol to communicate with its command and control (C2) server for further exploitation.

Okay, so I need to think about how these kinds of backdoors typically operate. Generally, after gaining initial access, attackers need a way to maintain that access and control the compromised system. That's where C2 comes in—they need to communicate with their C2 servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data.

Now, looking at the related TTPs: one is under the tactic of Command and Control, specifically Technique T1071.001, which is "Web Protocols." The other is under Initial Access, Technique T1195.002, which is "Compromise Software Supply Chain."

So, the Initial Access part makes sense—compromising the software supply chain is how they got in with Sunburst. But the Command and Control part is relevant to how they maintain communication after initial access.

T1071.001, "Web Protocols," suggests that the backdoor might use common web protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with the C2 server. This makes sense because web traffic is usually allowed through firewalls, making it less likely to be blocked.

Given that, it seems plausible that Sunburst would use a protocol like HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with its C2 server. This would allow it to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.

But let's think about the context of the Sunburst backdoor specifically. I recall that Sunburst was designed to be stealthy and maintain long-term access. Using standard web protocols would align with that goal, as it helps avoid raising alarms.

Moreover, using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS for C2 is a common practice among malware authors because it's easy to implement and hard to distinguish from legitimate traffic.

So, considering all that, it seems likely that Sunburst would use a protocol for C2 communication.

But wait, the question specifies "for further exploitation." Does that change anything?

Well, communication with C2 is often a step towards further exploitation—receiving additional payloads, exfiltrating data, etc. So, yes, that aligns with the purpose of C2.

Looking back at the answer choices, "Yes" seems to be the appropriate answer. It's likely that the Sunburst backdoor would communicate with its C2 server using a protocol for further exploitation.

Is there any reason to think otherwise? If I choose "No," that would imply that the backdoor doesn't use any protocol for C2 communication, which doesn't make sense. Malware needs to communicate with its C2 to receive instructions and perform actions.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking that the initial access method somehow precludes the use of protocols for C2. But that doesn't hold water because initial access and C2 are separate stages in the attack lifecycle.

Therefore, the most plausible answer is "Yes."
