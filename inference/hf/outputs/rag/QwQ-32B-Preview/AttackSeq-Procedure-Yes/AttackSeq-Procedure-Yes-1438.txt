Alright, I've got this question about ProjectM actors and their tactics. So, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question is: after these actors developed their custom tools and registered domains, possibly with WHOIS protection, did they gather victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance before gaining initial access through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks? And I have to choose between "Yes" and "No."

Okay, so let's break this down. ProjectM is likely a group of threat actors, and they've got their own custom tools for their campaigns. They register domains, some with WHOIS protection, which probably helps them stay anonymous. Now, the question is whether they gathered victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance phase before trying to get into the victims' systems through spear-phishing or watering hole attacks.

Alright, so reconnaissance is the phase where attackers gather information about their targets. Gather victim identity information sounds like they're collecting data about specific individuals or entities they plan to target. Spear-phishing is a targeted attack where they send malicious emails to specific people, so having identity information makes sense for crafting convincing phishing emails. Watering hole attacks involve compromising a website that the target is known to visit, so again, knowing about the victim's online behaviors or interests would help in selecting the right website to compromise.

Now, looking at the related TTPs provided:

1. Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information

2. Tactic: Initial Access, Technique: T1189 - Drive-by Compromise

3. Tactic: Reconnaissance, Technique: T1596.002 - WHOIS

So, T1589 is specifically about gathering victim identity information, which aligns directly with the question. T1189 is about drive-by compromises, which is a type of initial access where victims are infected by visiting a compromised website. And T1596.002 is about using WHOIS services, which relates to domain registration and potentially anonymity.

Given that, it seems like the attackers are doing reconnaissance by gathering victim identity information and using WHOIS protection for their domains. Then, they use this information to conduct initial access via spear-phishing or watering hole attacks.

So, considering that, it makes a lot of sense that they would gather victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance. In fact, it's a common practice in targeted attacks. Attackers need to know who they're going after to tailor their attacks effectively.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. **Develop custom toolset:** They create their own tools for their campaigns.

2. **Register domains:** Some with WHOIS protection to hide their identities.

3. **Gather victim identity information:** This would be part of their reconnaissance to understand their targets better.

4. **Conduct initial access:** Through spear-phishing emails and watering hole attacks, which require knowledge about the victims.

It seems like a logical sequence. Without knowing who their targets are, it would be hard to craft effective spear-phishing emails or to choose the right websites to compromise for watering hole attacks.

Moreover, the MITRE ATT&CK framework lists "Gather Victim Identity Information" under the reconnaissance tactic, which is typically performed before initial access. So, from a threat intelligence perspective, it's expected that attackers would engage in this behavior.

Is there any reason to think that they wouldn't do this? Well, if they didn't gather victim identity information, how would they know whom to target with spear-phishing emails or which websites to compromise for watering hole attacks? It just doesn't make much sense without that step.

Also, considering that they're using spear-phishing and watering hole attacks, which are targeted methods, they need specific information about their victims to make these attacks successful.

Furthermore, the fact that they're using WHOIS protection suggests that they're trying to hide their tracks, which is consistent with conducting reconnaissance to avoid detection.

So, all things considered, it's highly likely that they gathered victim identity information as part of their reconnaissance efforts before attempting initial access.

Therefore, the answer should be "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
