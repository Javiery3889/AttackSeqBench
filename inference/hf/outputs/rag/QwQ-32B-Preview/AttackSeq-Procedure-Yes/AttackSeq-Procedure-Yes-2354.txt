Alright, I've got this question about a cyber threat group called BRONZE PRESIDENT. They've compromised a network using phishing emails with LNK files and have achieved initial access. Now, the question is whether they're likely to escalate privileges using native tools like vssadmin on domain controllers to create volume shadow copies, and then use tools like Nmap and Nbtscan for network service discovery.

First, I need to understand the context here. BRONZE PRESIDENT is presumably a threat actor group, and they've already gained initial access through phishing emails with LNK files. LNK files are those Windows shortcut files that can contain malicious code, often used to bypass security measures.

So, after gaining initial access, the next steps would typically involve privilege escalation and discovery of the network to find valuable targets or data. The question is asking about a specific sequence of techniques they might use.

Let's look at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to decide which one is more plausible based on the information provided.

Now, the related TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are:

1. Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1018 - Remote System Discovery

2. Tactic: Discovery, Technique: T1046 - Network Service Discovery

3. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1006 - Direct Volume Access

So, these are the techniques that are relevant to the question.

Let's break this down.

First, the question mentions that after initial access, BRONZE PRESIDENT is likely to escalate privileges using vssadmin on domain controllers to create volume shadow copies.

Vssadmin is a command-line tool in Windows used to manage volume shadow copies, which are snapshots of data on a volume at a particular point in time. Creating volume shadow copies can be used for backup purposes, but in the context of an attack, it could be used to access files that are in use or to maintain persistence.

However, I'm not immediately sure how creating volume shadow copies directly helps in privilege escalation. Privilege escalation usually involves gaining higher-level access, such as administrative privileges, on a system or network.

Maybe the idea is that by creating a volume shadow copy, the attacker can access files or data that are normally protected or in use, and from there, find ways to escalate privileges.

But this seems a bit indirect. Typically, privilege escalation involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the system, misconfigurations, or using tools that exploit weaknesses in the authorization mechanisms.

So, I need to think about whether creating volume shadow copies is a common or effective method for privilege escalation.

Looking at the related TTPs, T1006 - Direct Volume Access is under Defense Evasion, which involves actions adversaries take to prevent their detection. Direct Volume Access could involve accessing raw disk data to evade detection by security software.

But in this case, the question is about privilege escalation, not necessarily evasion.

Maybe there's a connection I'm missing.

Next, the question mentions that after any privilege escalation, they would use tools like Nmap and Nbtscan for network service discovery.

Nmap is a well-known network exploration and security auditing tool that can be used to discover hosts and services on a network. Nbtscan is a tool used to query NetBIOS name service information from remote hosts.

Both of these tools fall under the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically Techniques T1018 - Remote System Discovery and T1046 - Network Service Discovery.

So, it makes sense that after gaining initial access and potentially escalating privileges, an attacker would want to map out the network to understand the environment better, identify high-value targets, and plan further steps.

But the question is about whether the specific sequence of using vssadmin for privilege escalation and then using Nmap and Nbtscan for discovery is plausible.

Given that, I need to evaluate if using vssadmin for privilege escalation is a likely step for BRONZE PRESIDENT.

Let me consider alternative methods of privilege escalation that are more commonly known.

Common privilege escalation techniques include:

- Exploiting vulnerabilities in software or services running with higher privileges.

- Misconfigurations in group policies, permissions, or access controls.

- Credential dumping and pivoting.

- Exploiting weak passwords or re-used credentials.

- Using PowerShell or other scripting languages to automate tasks that require higher privileges.

Vssadmin, being a native Windows tool, could be used as part of a living off the land approach, where attackers use legitimate tools to perform their operations to avoid detection.

But is creating volume shadow copies a standard method for privilege escalation?

I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to look into how vssadmin can be used in the context of an attack.

Upon some thought, perhaps creating volume shadow copies could allow an attacker to access files that are in use or protected, which might contain sensitive information or configuration files that could be exploited for privilege escalation.

For example, if an attacker can access a file that stores credentials or configuration settings that allow for higher-level access, then creating a volume shadow copy to access that file could be a step in the privilege escalation process.

However, this still seems like an indirect method. It might be more straightforward for an attacker to look for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that directly grant higher privileges.

Another possibility is that the attacker uses vssadmin to create a snapshot and then accesses the shadow copy to install backdoors or maintain persistence, rather than directly escalating privileges.

But again, that seems more related to maintaining access rather than escalating privileges.

Given this, I'm starting to lean towards answer choice B: No. It doesn't seem like using vssadmin to create volume shadow copies is a direct or common method for privilege escalation.

Moreover, the related TTPs mention Discovery techniques and Defense Evasion, but not specifically privilege escalation techniques.

Perhaps the question is trying to suggest that BRONZE PRESIDENT would use vssadmin as part of their discovery process or evasion tactics, rather than for privilege escalation.

But the question specifically mentions privilege escalation using vssadmin.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something about how vssadmin can be used for privilege escalation.

Let me think differently.

If an attacker has limited privileges and uses vssadmin to create a volume shadow copy, and then accesses that shadow copy to read files that are normally restricted, that could be seen as a form of privilege escalation because they're gaining access to data they shouldn't normally be able to access.

However, this is more about data exfiltration or reconnaissance rather than traditional privilege escalation, which is about gaining higher-level access rights.

So, perhaps the term "privilege escalation" is being used loosely here.

But in the context of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, privilege escalation is specifically about gaining higher permissions or access rights on a system or network.

Given that, using vssadmin to access files that are otherwise restricted due to permissions could be considered a form of privilege escalation, as the attacker is effectively bypassing those permissions.

In that case, it might make sense.

However, I still think that more direct methods of privilege escalation are more commonly used by attackers.

Furthermore, creating volume shadow copies on domain controllers could be risky, as domain controllers hold critical information, and any unusual activity could trigger alerts.

So, from an operational security perspective, it might not be the most discreet method.

Additionally, using native tools like vssadmin could help evade detection if the environment doesn't have strict monitoring in place, but it's still unusual behavior that could be detected by advanced monitoring systems.

Now, moving on to the second part of the sequence: using Nmap and Nbtscan for network service discovery.

This seems entirely plausible.

Once an attacker has gained initial access and, potentially, escalated privileges, the next logical step is to map out the network to understand what systems and services are available.

Nmap and Nbtscan are standard tools for this purpose.

Nmap can be used to discover active hosts and open ports, while Nbtscan can be used to query NetBIOS information, which is useful in Windows environments to discover system names, user names, and shared resources.

Both of these activities fall under the Discovery tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically Techniques T1018 and T1046, which are mentioned in the related TTPs.

So, if the first part of the sequence (using vssadmin for privilege escalation) is plausible, and the second part (using Nmap and Nbtscan for discovery) is definitely plausible, then the entire sequence could be considered plausible.

However, given my earlier reservations about the use of vssadmin for privilege escalation, I'm still leaning towards answer choice B: No.

Perhaps there are more straightforward and common methods that BRONZE PRESIDENT would use for privilege escalation.

Alternatively, maybe BRONZE PRESIDENT does use vssadmin for other purposes, such as data exfiltration or maintaining persistence, but not specifically for privilege escalation.

Given the information provided, I don't have enough evidence to confirm that using vssadmin for privilege escalation is a likely step in their attack sequence.

Therefore, I would choose answer B: No.

But to be thorough, let's consider if there are any specific indicators or known behaviors of BRONZE PRESIDENT that might support the use of vssadmin for privilege escalation.

Unfortunately, I don't have specific knowledge about BRONZE PRESIDENT's tactics, techniques, and procedures. It's possible that this group has unique methods that include using vssadmin in this way.

However, based on general knowledge of cyber threat actor behaviors and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, I still believe that more conventional privilege escalation methods are more likely.

In conclusion, while the second part of the sequence (using Nmap and Nbtscan for discovery) is plausible, the first part (using vssadmin for privilege escalation) seems less likely.

Therefore, the entire sequence as described in the question appears less plausible.

Hence
