Alright, I've got this question about a cyber attack attributed to Deep Panda, and I need to figure out the most plausible sequence of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) based on the given information. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the question describes an initial access vector: exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in VMware Horizon servers. I know that Log4Shell is a critical vulnerability in Apache Log4j, which is widely used in many applications, including VMware products. So, it makes sense that attackers would target this vulnerability to gain initial access.

Once they've gained access, the attackers spawn PowerShell processes to download and execute scripts. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and shell that's built into Windows operating systems. It's commonly abused by attackers because it's ubiquitous and can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, from executing commands to manipulating system settings.

Now, the question asks whether it's likely that Deep Panda will execute PowerShell scripts and a batch file to perform tasks such as downloading and running additional files before ensuring persistence by copying the Milestone backdoor to %APPDATA%\newdev.dll and creating a registry-based service named msupdate2.

Let's look at the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to decide between these two options based on the attack sequence described and the related TTPs provided.

The related TTPs mention:

Tactic: Execution

Technique: T1059.001 - PowerShell

This aligns with what's described in the question, as the attackers are using PowerShell to execute scripts and perform various tasks.

So, considering that the attackers have already used PowerShell to download and execute scripts, it's plausible that they would continue to use it for further activities, such as downloading and running additional files.

Moreover, establishing persistence is a common step in an attack lifecycle. Attackers typically want to maintain access to the compromised system even after reboots or other interruptions. The method described—copying a backdoor to the AppData directory and creating a registry-based service— is a typical way to achieve persistence.

The AppData directory is a hidden directory in Windows where applications store user data. Storing malicious files there can help hide them from casual inspection. Creating a registry-based service ensures that the backdoor is started automatically at system boot.

Given this context, the sequence of actions described in the question seems consistent with common attacker behaviors.

But, to make sure, I should consider if there are any red flags or inconsistencies in the sequence.

First, the initial access is through Log4Shell in VMware Horizon servers. Then, they use PowerShell to download and execute scripts. Next, they presumably use PowerShell or another script to download additional files and run them. Finally, they establish persistence by placing a backdoor in the AppData directory and creating a registry service.

Each step seems logical and follows a typical attack progression: initial access, execution, privilege escalation (if necessary), lateral movement, and persistence.

Moreover, the use of PowerShell is consistent throughout, which aligns with the related TTPs provided.

I don't see any immediate reasons to doubt the plausibility of this sequence.

Therefore, it's likely that Deep Panda would follow this sequence of actions in their attack.

So, the answer should be:

Final Answer: A: Yes
