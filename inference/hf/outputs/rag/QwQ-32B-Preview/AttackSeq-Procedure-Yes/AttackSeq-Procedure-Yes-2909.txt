Alright, I've got this question about cybersecurity, specifically regarding the AtomBombing technique and its implications on process-level restrictions and security products. I need to decide between "Yes" and "No" based on the related Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) provided.

First, let's break down the question. It's asking whether, after using the AtomBombing technique to execute malicious code via atom tables, threat actors are likely to use this to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.

So, I need to understand what AtomBombing is and how it relates to process injection and evasion techniques.

From what I know, AtomBombing is a method that abuses the Windows atom tables to inject code into other processes. Atom tables are global tables that store strings and associated integer identifiers called atoms. Attackers can manipulate these tables to plant malicious code in the address space of another process, which can then be executed.

Now, looking at the related TTPs:

1. Tactic: Privilege Escalation, Technique: T1055.004 - Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC)

2. Tactic: Defense Evasion, Technique: T1055 - Process Injection

So, both related techniques fall under process injection, which aligns with what AtomBombing does. Process injection is a method where an attacker inserts code into another process's address space to execute it there. This can help bypass security measures and gain higher privileges.

Given that, let's consider the answer choices:

A: Yes

B: No

I need to determine if it's likely that threat actors will use AtomBombing to bypass process-level restrictions and evade security products by injecting code into trusted processes.

Well, process injection techniques like AtomBombing are designed to do exactly that: inject code into other processes to evade detection and bypass restrictions. So, intuitively, the answer seems to be "Yes."

But let's dig deeper.

First, why would attackers want to bypass process-level restrictions? Typically, these restrictions are in place to limit what a process can do, for security and stability reasons. By bypassing them, attackers can perform actions that would otherwise be prohibited, such as accessing certain resources or executing specific commands.

Second, evading security products is a key goal for attackers. Security software often monitors processes for unusual behavior, and injecting code into trusted processes can make malicious activities harder to detect because the security products might trust the host process.

Now, considering the related TTPs:

- Privilege Escalation: T1055.004 - Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC)

APC is a specific type of process injection where the attacker queues an APC to a thread in the target process, which causes the thread to execute the attacker's code when it enters an alertable state. This is a method to inject and execute code in the context of another process.

- Defense Evasion: T1055 - Process Injection

This is a broader category that includes various methods of process injection, such as AtomBombing, DLL injection, process hollowing, and more. The goal is to hide malicious code within legitimate processes to evade detection.

Given that both related TTPs are directly related to process injection and its uses for privilege escalation and defense evasion, it's clear that AtomBombing fits into this category.

Therefore, it's highly likely that threat actors would use AtomBombing to achieve the objectives mentioned in the question: bypassing process-level restrictions and evading security products by injecting code into trusted processes.

Moreover, historical examples show that attackers frequently use process injection techniques for these purposes. Security products are continually evolving to detect such techniques, but attackers also adapt by developing new methods or modifying existing ones to evade detection.

In conclusion, based on the alignment of AtomBombing with the related TTPs and the known uses of process injection in cyber attacks, the answer is "Yes."

**Final Answer: A**
