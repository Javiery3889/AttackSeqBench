The emails targeted various departments within the defense industry, claiming to have urgent updates on COVID-19. The attackers registered email accounts that resembled the medical center's real email addresses and included the actual personal data of the deputy head doctor in the signature. The phishing emails contained a malicious Word document designed to download and execute additional malware.\nInitial Access: The initial access was achieved through spear-phishing emails containing malicious Word documents. The documents, which were unrelated to COVID-19, contained macros that, when enabled, would download and execute additional malware. The attackers sent follow-up emails instructing recipients on how to enable macros. The infection was successful when an employee opened one of the attachments, allowing the attackers to gain remote control of the infected system.\nExecution: The malware, known as ThreatNeedle, was executed in a multistage deployment procedure. It began with a spear-phishing document that loaded the next stage as a backdoor running in-memory. The ThreatNeedle backdoor was used for initial reconnaissance and to deploy additional malware for lateral movement.\nPersistence: The ThreatNeedle installer-type malware was responsible for implanting the next stage loader-type malware and registering it for auto-execution to achieve persistence. The loader-type malware existed in several variations and served the primary purpose of loading the final stage of the ThreatNeedle malware in-memory.\nDefense Evasion: The Lazarus group utilized various techniques to evade detection, including deleting log files from the router and using a custom web shell script. They also employed masquerading techniques, such as renaming system utilities and modifying registry keys to hide their activities.\nCredential Access: The group executed a credential harvesting tool named Responder from one of the victim machines to acquire login credentials, which were then used for lateral movement.\nLateral Movement: Lateral movement was achieved using Windows commands and the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) to establish network connections and copy malware to remote hosts. The attackers also compromised a router virtual machine to overcome network segmentation and access the restricted network segment.\nCollection: The group archived collected data using utilities to prepare for exfiltration.\nCommand and Control: The command-and-control infrastructure involved multiple servers for various stages, with the attackers configuring the Apache web server on a compromised router to use it as a proxy server between the organization's corporate and restricted segments.\nExfiltration: Data exfiltration was performed using a custom tunneling tool with a custom encryption routine to create a covert channel. The group also used a Trojanized VNC Uploader to upload data to the C2 server via HTTP POST requests.\nOthers: The Lazarus group's campaign against the defense industry was attributed to their use of the ThreatNeedle malware cluster, which is an advanced version of Manuscrypt (a.k.a.

The campaign spoofed various banks in CIS countries, including Halyk Bank, PrivatBank, Idea Bank, and Tejara Bank, with the most recent observed on May 28, 2018.\nPersistence: The PowerShell script setup.ps1 created a cmdlet to establish persistence by creating a Windows service named 'Check for updates' set to 'delay-auto' start and execute checkupdate.ps1. Additionally, a dropper executable binary was used to reflectively load SOCKSBOT into a chosen process, ensuring persistence by creating copies of itself in system directories and spoofing legitimate services with similar names.\nDefense Evasion: The SOCKSBOT implant, delivered as a Base64-encoded string, was reflectively loaded in a newly started svchost.exe process, existing only in memory and never touching the disk. It used the ObtainUserAgentString API to determine the default user-agent of the machine and communicated with the C2 server using a pseudo-randomly generated URI.\nCommand and Control: The SOCKSBOT implant communicated with C2 servers using sockets and specific HTTP status codes to perform actions such as creating new sockets, enumerating processes, taking screenshots, and performing file operations. Three different C2 servers were observed: 5.8.88[.]64, 46.166.163[.]243, and 5.135.73[.]113.\nOthers: The Goldfin campaign, using SOCKSBOT, targeted financial institutions in CIS countries for financial gain. The campaign is not believed to be associated with CANDLEFISH but has infrastructure overlap and shared use of a PowerShell obfuscation technique with FIN7. Domains used in the campaign had identical WHOIS information and network hosting overlap with domains associated with FIN7. The campaign also used a variant of a PowerShell obfuscation technique similar to PowerSploit, previously observed in malware associated with FIN7.

Recently, it has exploited COVID-19 fears, directing victims to fake websites via spam emails. The spam emails contain links to websites offering these fake updates or exploiting current events for malicious purposes.\nPersistence: To ensure persistence, Grandoreiro creates a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory. This allows the malware to maintain its foothold on the system across restarts and other interruptions.\nPrivilege Escalation: Grandoreiro employs various techniques to gain higher-level permissions, including hooking APIs to prevent loading DLLs of banking protection software, attempting to kill their processes, blocking them at the firewall level, and changing file system paths to disable them. It also monitors hooks on important functions and employs a method for privilege escalation by registering a binary as the default handler for .MSC files, then running such a file to execute with elevated privileges.\nCredential Access: Grandoreiro is capable of stealing credentials stored in the Google Chrome web browser and data stored in Microsoft Outlook.\nDiscovery: Grandoreiro collects information about its victims, including computer name, username, operating system version and bitness, and whether specific banking protection software is installed. It also lists installed security products.\nCommand and Control: Grandoreiro communicates with its C&C server using the RealThinClient SDK, which operates over HTTP. It performs a handshake and checks for commands every few seconds. The first command received from the C&C server is a list of all currently connected victims, including collected information about their machines.\nOthers: Grandoreiro has been active since at least 2017, targeting Brazil, Peru, Mexico, and Spain. It is written in Delphi and has been rapidly developed, with several new versions each month.

The affected version, CCleaner 5.33, released on August 15, 2017, contained a multi-stage malware payload. The 32-bit CCleaner binary included in the installer had been modified to execute malicious code before proceeding with the normal CCleaner operations. This version was hosted on CCleaner's download server until September 11, 2017, and was signed with a valid certificate issued to Piriform Ltd by Symantec, valid through October 10, 2018. A second malicious sample was also discovered, signed approximately 15 minutes after the first one.\nExecution: The malicious 32-bit CCleaner binary from the installer for version 5.33 was modified to call to the code at CC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C), redirecting code execution flow to the malicious code. This initiated the decryption of data containing two stages of the malicious payload: a Position Independent Code (PIC) PE loader and a DLL file functioning as the malware payload. The malware author attempted to evade detection by zeroing out the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER. The binary created an executable heap, copied the decrypted malware to it, and then called the PE loader to begin its operation. After initiating the infection process, the binary erased the memory regions containing the PE loader and the DLL file, destroyed the heap, and continued with normal CCleaner operations.\nDefense Evasion: The malware payload within CCleaner 5.33 attempted to evade detection by zeroing out the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER and using a valid digital signature. The malicious DLL file, CBkdr.dll, was modified to avoid detection, and the DLLEntryPoint created an execution thread to return control to the loader. This thread was responsible for calling CCBkdr_GetShellcodeFromC2AndCall and setting up a Return Oriented Programming (ROP) chain to deallocate memory associated with the DLL and exit the thread.\nImpact: The impact of the attack could be severe due to the high number of systems potentially affected. CCleaner claimed over 2 billion downloads worldwide as of November 2016. Affected systems needed to be restored to a state before August 15, 2017, or reinstalled, and users were advised to update to the latest version of CCleaner, which at the time of the report was version 5.34.\nOthers: The CTI report includes additional information about the investigation and response to the threat. Cisco Talos released ClamAV signatures 6336251 and 6336252 to detect the threat. Advanced Malware Protection (AMP), Cisco's Web Security Appliance (WSA), AMP Threat Grid, and Umbrella were recommended for protection against the threat. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) were provided, including file hashes, DGA domains, and IP addresses. The report also noted that antivirus detection for this threat was low at the time of writing.\nQuestion: After the CCleaner malware executed its initial payload by decrypting and loading malicious components, which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the malware used fallback Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) for establishing communication in the absence of a response from hardcoded Command and Control servers?\nAnswer Choices: A: T1562.008-Disable or Modify Cloud Logs\nB: T1106-Native API\nC: T1568-Dynamic Resolution\nD: T1071.003-Mail Protocols"}]}}

During the investigation, an archive containing files from the C2 server was provided, which included web server configuration files and a MySQL database reflecting research activity. The attackers targeted specific organizations, including Cisco, through the delivery of a second-stage loader. The C2 tracking database indicated that at least 20 victim machines were served specialized secondary payloads.\nExecution: The web directory from the C2 server contained PHP files responsible for controlling communications with infected systems. The PHP files included checks to determine whether to proceed with standard operations or redirect to the legitimate Piriform website. The PHP script contained references to the required table for information storage within the 'x.php' variables. The 'init.php' file defined core variables and operations, specifying 'PRC' as the time zone and the database configuration to use. The PHP script compared the system beaconing to the C2 to three values: $DomainList, $IPList, and $HostList, to determine if the infected system should be delivered a Stage 2 payload. The attackers controlled which infected systems were delivered a Stage 2 payload, with 20 unique hosts identified as affected.\nDiscovery: The PHP script gathered information from infected systems, including OS version, architecture, administrative rights, hostname, and domain name. The system profile information was aggressive, including a list of installed software and all current running processes. The system profile information was stored in the MySQL database. The attackers used this reconnaissance information to determine which machines to target in the final stages of the campaign.\nOthers: The stage 2 installer, GeeSetup_x86.dll, checked the OS version and dropped either a 32-bit or 64-bit version of a trojanized tool. The x86 version used a trojanized TSMSISrv.dll, while the x64 version dropped a trojanized EFACli64.dll. The setup put an encoded PE in the registry, which was executed by the trojanized files. The stage 3 payload reached out to additional C2 servers and executed in-memory PE files. A lightweight backdoor module in the registry retrieved an IP from data steganographically hidden in a GitHub or WordPress search, from which an additional PE module was downloaded and run. Talos reviewed claims of code overlap with malware samples known to be used by Group 72, confirming the overlap. The attack was sophisticated, targeting technology companies through a supply chain attack to compromise a large number of victims persistently, in hopes to land payloads on computers at specific target networks. Indicators of compromise associated with the attack were provided.\nQuestion: Which ATT&CK technique most likely occurred before the attackers managed infected systems through a C2 database that described machines receiving the second-stage payload based on information about running processes, OS version, and installed software?\nAnswer Choices: A: T1195-Supply Chain Compromise\nB: T1095-Non-Application Layer Protocol\nC: T1059.007-JavaScript\nD: T1105-Ingress Tool Transfer"}]}}
